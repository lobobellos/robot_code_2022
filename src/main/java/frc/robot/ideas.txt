Changes 4/4/2022
1. Fix alignment with limelight
2. Add "reset" button to shooter (button 11);

Ideas for how alignment will work:
    1. User control will not work until robot is alligned with hoop isAlligned will keep track of that.
    2. runShooter doesn't run the shooteritself, it just alligns the robot, user can choose to shoot. 
    3. The way the shooter will work is by alligning the robot so that it's 30in from the hoop, and the robot is alligned to shoot.
